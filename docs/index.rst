Welcome to Numpy2Vtk's documentation!
=====================================

The Numpy2Vtk library is an easy way to render `numpy`_ data in the `VTK`_ visualization framework. It is designed
as a thin wrapper around VTK that returns ready-to-render VTK objects. This way a lot of boilerplate code that usually
needs to be written when using VTK to render numpy data can be avoided.

If you want to report bugs and/or submit feature requests, please do so at `Numpy2Vtk's github page`_.
